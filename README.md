My first solo react app without following any tutorials.

The main goal is to throw myself into the deep end with the toolset that I currently have - which is useState hook and props without context management or other hooks. I did end up learning useEffect for the project though.

The app is basically a todo with no persistent memory for now. The project and the hurdles I ran into really helped me understand the data flow better and the benefits of organizing parent/children components well because I ended up having to pass around data way more than I should've than if I were to make the app from the beginning now.

It is also my first time using and learning Tailwind along with DaisyUI - love the experience.
